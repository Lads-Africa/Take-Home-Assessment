PRODUCTS-DELETE-NOTFOUND-001,Deleting non-existing product ID returns internal exception details instead of clean 404 JSON,"When attempting to delete a product that does not exist, the API responds with HTTP 404 but includes internal exception details in the response body. The error message exposes the underlying Eloquent model class (App\\Models\\Product), framework exception class (NotFoundHttpException), file paths, and stack trace. This leaks implementation details and is not suitable for a production-facing REST API, where a simple, sanitized 404 JSON error should be returned instead.","Login as admin via API:

Endpoint: POST /api/login

Body:

{
  ""email"": ""admin@test.com"",
  ""password"": ""password""
}


Copy the token value from the response.

Send a DELETE request for a non-existing product ID:

Endpoint: DELETE /api/products/999 (or any ID that does not exist)

Headers:

Accept: application/json

Authorization: Bearer <admin_token>

Observe the response body and status code.","HTTP status: 404 Not Found

Response body should be a clean, minimal JSON error, for example:

{
  ""message"": ""Product not found.""
}


No internal framework details, model names, file paths, or stack traces should be exposed.","HTTP status: 404 Not Found

Response body contains internal framework and application details, e.g.:

{

  ""file"": ""/.../vendor/laravel/framework/src/Illuminate/Foundation/Exceptions/Handler.php"",
